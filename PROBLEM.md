**This exercise contains a class named NumberAverage with the following methods:**

     +FindAverage(int[]) : String  
         - Should take positive integer array as input and return a String with the average calculated
         - The average of the array should be calculated by using a for-each loop 
         - Should send error message if all value in array are not positive
         - Should send error message if array is empty
